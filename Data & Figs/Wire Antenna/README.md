### `Analytical_Model_WireAnt.mlx`

MATLAB live script implementing:

- Analytical expressions for **characteristic-mode (eigenchannel) currents** of a thin-wire antenna
- Computation of **far-field radiation patterns** for individual eigenchannels
- Demonstration of **current asymmetry** induced by superposition of multiple eigenchannels
- Visualization of **far-field intensity** using a 3D cut-shell representation

The script includes:

- Parameter definitions
- Analytical model equations
- Visualization routines
- Fully reproducible figure generation

All figures can be regenerated by running the live script.
